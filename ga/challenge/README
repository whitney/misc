This program requires the installation of sympy (http://sympy.org/), a small 
symbolic math package written in pure python. This is easily built from source 
which can be obtained from github:

$ git clone git://github.com/sympy/sympy.git
$ cd sympy
$ sudo python setup.py install

To run this program (python must be installed and int_seq.py must be executable):
./int_seq.py '1,9,25,49'

Complexity:
Assume the number of integers in the input sequence is n, then
the complexity of the main() method can be decomposed into: 
O(gen_matrices()) + O(gen_equations()) + O(gen_poly()) + O(sympy.solve(<a system of n equations>))
These helper methods have the following complexities:
gen_matrices(): O(n^2)
gen_equations(): O(n^2)
gen_poly(): O(n)
So, ignoring the complexity of sympy's solve() method the main() method has an overall complexity of
O(n^2)
